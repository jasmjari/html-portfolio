<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Selena</h3>
<p>One of my all time favorite artist. I love the way the story of her short life was told.</p>

<h3>Raising Victor Vargas</h3>
<p>This movie shows what it is like to grow up being Dominican in NYC.  Brings back many memories of my childhood.</p>

<h3>Enough</h3>
<p>Amazing movie that show the reality that many women face when it comes to domestic violence.  The victim gets their happy ending.</p>
